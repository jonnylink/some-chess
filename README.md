# some-chess
A PHP, MySQL correspondent chess app. This was written in 2005-2006. It was adapted into a Facebook app, into Google Earth (somehow) and translated into several languages. If you played chess on Facebook, it was likely a port of this. It is also what became chess.com

## History
This was how I first challenged myself when learning to code. As all works of this nature, there's a lot to be embarrassed about in here (for example, I hadn't learned about object orient programming yet). It should also be noted that this likely won't work in a modern environment. It is placed on here now for historical purposes with a small idea that I might pick it back up and update it.
