These are mostly to help me with debugging, they are also designed to make it so that people can 
more easily report any bugs they run into and to not give outsiders too much info about the database. 
The error codes are letters followed by numbers, the letters correspond to a specific function or 
call while the numbers specify the exact point at which the error is occuring.  Below is a key for 
the possible errors.
