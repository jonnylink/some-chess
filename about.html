				<h2>Some Info</h2>

				<h3>Standard Games</h3>
				<p>Standard games are exactly that, standard. All the official chess rules and opening positions apply.</p>

				<h3>Random Games</h3>
				<p>Random games are played almost exactly like standard games. The difference is that the starting positions are randomized and 
				that castling is different. To castle you move you king two squares to the left or the right, the castle will move to the king's
				opposite side.  Note: Some Chess random chess follows the rules of Chess 960, except for castling 
				(<a href="http://www.schemingmind.com/journalarticle.aspx?article_id=18">read why here</a>).</p>
				
				<h3>Moving</h3>
				<p>You move in Some Chess by clicking first on the square you want to 
				move from and then on the square you'd like to move to.</p>
				
				<h3>Castling</h3>
				<p>The rule when castling is that you always move your king first.  In Some Chess 
				you move you king first and the rook will automaticaly go to the proper square.</p>
				
				<h3>Pawn Promotion</h3>
				<p>Once you get your pawn to the other player's back line you will be given the 
				choice of what to promote the pawn to.</p>
				
				<h3>Stalemate</h3>
				<p>Right now Some Chess doesn't know what a stalemate is.  The honor system is nice, 
				both players should agree to draw (which is what a stalemate is).</p>
				
				<h3>Resign</h3>
				<p>If you want to give up click the "Resign" button.  The game will be end and 
				it will be counted as a loss for you.  Be careful because there is no way to undo this.</p>
				
				<h3>Draw</h3>
				<p>You can suggest a draw at anytime by clicking on the "Draw" button.  Your opponent must accept, 
				otherwise the game will continue. To reject a draw offer all you have to do is make your next move.</p>
				
				<h3>Undo</h3>
				<p>You can request an undo within thiry seconds of your last move.  Your opponent must accept, otherwise the game
				will continue. To reject an undo request all you have to do is make your next move. <i>(Note: this function must be enabled
				by an admin)</i></p>
				
				<h3>Ending a Game</h3>
				<p>If a player hasn't made a move in a long time you will get the option to end the game. To end a 
				game click on the game in the menu, there will now be a "End" button in the options panel under the chess board. If there are 
				two or more complete moves in the game the win will go to the person who moved last, otherwise the game will simply be deleted. 
				Be careful because there is no way to undo this. Note, the default for the number of days before the "end" option appears
				is twenty, but the admin can set this number higher or lower.</p>
				
				<h3>Points</h3>
				<p>Points are calculated using the standard system, the number of wins plus the number of draws divided by two 
				or Wins + (Draws/2) = Points.</p>
				
				<h3>Notation</h3>
				<p>Some Chess uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation" class="about">pgn</a> 
				notation, which you can export once the game is complete.  This is a nice way to save &amp; play through 
				your games again in another program, etc.</p>
				
				<h3>Importing PGN</h3>
				<p>To view a past game that is not in the database, played on Some Chess or elsewhere, all you need
				to do is paste the entire contents of the game into the field under the "Import Game" option.</p>
				
				<h3>Adding a User Image</h3>
				<p>If this option is enabled you can add a custom image to your account. The option is located
				in the "Profile" window of the "Menu" page, just click "browse" and locate any image file.  Please note that the image will 
				be automatically resized to 85x85 pixels. The following image formats are accepted PNG, GIF, and JPG. <i>(Note: this function must be enabled
				by an admin)</i></p>
				
				<h3>Gonna Forget Your Password?</h3>
				<p>In order to reset your password you'll need to put in a security question and answer, otherwise
				you'll have to ask an admin to do it manually.</p>

				<h2>Some Trouble</h2>
				<p>If you find something that Some Chess is doing wrong, or find something that Some Chess should 
				be doing, <a href="mailto:jon@astrodogpress.com">please let me know</a>.</p>
				
				<p>If Some Chess doesn't look nice to you, you're probably using MS Internet Explorer.  
				Stop doing that.  Seriously though, MS Internet Explorer has a lot of bugs  doesn't follow important standards 
				which makes it difficult to code for, I'll be making an effort to ensure that Some Chess is usuable in IE, but 
				it is a very low priority.  I am sorry, but any other modern browser (ex. firefox, safari, opera, camino)  
				works perfectly.</p>
				
				<p>Finally, I just want to say thanks for using this.  Thanks.</p>
